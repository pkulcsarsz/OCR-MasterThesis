This repositar contains all files for the master thesis. 

The repositar contains two datasets. Both of them contains all letters from A to Z and numbers from 0 to 9. The first dataset is black on white, and the other contains colored images that were generated from patterns.

The other files are written in python. The main file contains the commands that run the test scenario for the desired architecture. The architectures are written in the models.py file. There are other files that function as helpers for other commands.
